# Libraries

As these component libraries may have different licences and including them directly may cause problems, only the directories are included. Inside each of them a README is included with a link where the component can be found. just download it and add it to the directory. All have the .kicad_sym and the 3D model (step) on the main folder, and a footprints.pretty folder with the footprints, except the HM72L, which don't have subfolders.
